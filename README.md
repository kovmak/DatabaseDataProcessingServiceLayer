# Database Data Processing Service Layer

This project, Database Data Processing Service Layer, is dedicated to constructing an efficient service layer for database interaction using the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern. It adheres to SOLID principles and GRASP patterns, emphasizing high cohesion and low coupling. The system seamlessly interacts with relational databases through JDBC, streamlining various data processing tasks.

## Overview

The Database Data Processing Service Layer system aims to establish a robust service layer on top of the DAO pattern, enabling efficient data processing. Each entity class utilizes the Builder pattern for construction, ensuring flexibility and readability. The Singleton pattern is employed for classes handling CRUD operations, providing a single point of access to the database. Additionally, the Factory Method pattern is utilized for creating instances of DAO classes, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## Task

This session involved refining the validation logic implemented in the previous practices by refactoring the code and extracting it into separate service classes. The main goal was to enhance the maintainability and organization of the codebase. Additionally, a new authentication service was introduced to authenticate users based on their credentials.

## Database Schema

The database schema for the Database Data Processing Service Layer system comprises multiple tables, each representing an entity in the domain model. The schema includes tables for entities like Animals, Enclosures, Employees, Visitors, and any additional entities required to model the domain accurately.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Database Data Processing Service Layer system follows these guidelines:

- Each entity class implements the Builder pattern for object construction, providing flexibility and readability.
- Classes responsible for CRUD operations utilize the Singleton pattern to ensure a single instance for database access.
- The Factory Method pattern is used to create instances of DAO classes, promoting consistency and maintainability.
- Custom validation logic has been refactored and moved into separate service classes for better organization and maintainability.

## Testing

Functional testing of the Database Data Processing Service Layer system is conducted using dedicated test classes. Test data is used to validate CRUD operations and ensure data integrity and validity across the system.
